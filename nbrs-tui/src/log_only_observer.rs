//! `LogOnlyObserver` — `RunObserver` impl for `tui=off` mode.
//!
//! Mirror image of [`crate::observer::TuiObserver`] but with no
//! TUI thread, no terminal takeover, and no alt-screen. Every
//! observer-lifecycle callback fires two writes:
//!
//! 1. Send the corresponding [`crate::run_state_actor::RunStateCmd`]
//!    to the actor so the snapshot is populated. This makes the
//!    inspector socket / web API work in `tui=off` mode and gives
//!    the future Ctrl-T toggle a non-empty state to display.
//! 2. Synchronously write the same line to stderr (filtered by
//!    `min_level`). Identical output to the legacy
//!    [`nbrs_activity::observer::StderrObserver`] path —
//!    operators see no behaviour change.
//!
//! This is the minimum-viable observer for Phase 1 of the
//! display-sink refactor (see [`crate::display_sink`]). Phase 2
//! moves the stderr writes onto a separate
//! [`crate::log_only_sink::LogOnlySink`] thread that drains
//! [`crate::state::RunState::log_seq_total`] from the actor's
//! snapshots, so the same observer can drive a TUI sink, a
//! line-mode emulation sink, or a plain-stderr sink without
//! changing the observer surface.
