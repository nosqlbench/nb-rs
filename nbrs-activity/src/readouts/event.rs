//! [`Event`] — the slot that triggered the current render.
//!
//! See SRD-63 §4.1. Two kinds of events exist:
//!
//! - **Lifecycle events** — fire exactly once per
//!   `(slot, subject)`. `_start` and `_end` are
//!   delaminated; nothing fires twice for the same
//!   subject under one slot.
//! - **Refresh events** — fire repeatedly while the
//!   subject is in flight. Currently only [`Event::Update`].
//!
//! Push 2 wires `Update` and `PhaseEnd` through the activity
//! pipeline; the remaining variants are reachable from Push 3
//! onward as the workload-side `readouts:` parser maps slot
//! names to events and Push 4 wires wildcard binding to
//! cover scope and session lifecycles.
